# Naviance Blue Ridge API Typescript & Node.js application
This is derived from the [placeholder app](../placeholder/README.md).

It uses GNU make to create the archive, run:

   make

This assumes that the `navianceblue-ridge-api` and `family-connection-ui` projects are checked out in parallel with the `cloud-deployment-scripts` repository and that the `navianceblue-ridge-api` repository is already completed.
